* What is a cookie?

  - A cookie is a piece of information stored in the user's browser that is not encrypted, for use
    in controllers and other website mechanics.

* What’s the difference between a session and a cookie?

  - A session is encrypted to prevent tampering, a cookie is not.

* What’s a flash and when do you want to use flashes?

  - A flash is a preset key, similar to a parameter, that is used to contain specific messages that can
    be displayed when certain actions are performed.

* Why do people say “HTTP is stateless”?

  - Every time a controller action is called, a new instance of that controller (and view(s)) is invoked.

* What’s authentication? Explain.

  - Authentication is the act of checking a clients sessions or cookies to assertain whether or not they have
    the right privileges to call certain actions or see certain content, etc.

* What’s the difference between authentication and authorization?

  - Authorization refers to when a user's information is checked initially to grant them certain sessions,
    whereas authentication is done site-wide.

* What’s a before filter?

  - Automatic methods that are called before controller actions.

* How do we keep track of a user once they’ve logged in?

  - Their ID or other identifying information is stored in a session key value.

* When do you want to namespace a resource? When do you want to nest a resource? What's the differences between those two approaches?

  - A resource should be namespaced when collections of the resource belong to a specific instance of the
    thing being referenced by the namespace. It should be nested when the greater resource has its own controller
    actions.

* At a high level, what tools can you use to implement authorization? How would you use them?

  - I would use sessions to differentiate between authorized clients and I would use encryption softwares
    like bcrypt to encrypt passwords and other sensitive information.

* What's an enum, and what advantages does it offer? What data type needs to be in your database to use an enum? Where do you declare an enum?

  - An enum is a collection of aliases, dependent on the specific value of the integer value of a specific
    attribute of a model. For instance, an admin could be stored as a 1, and a user as a 0. An enum is declared
    in a model.

* What are some strategies you can use to keep your views DRY?
