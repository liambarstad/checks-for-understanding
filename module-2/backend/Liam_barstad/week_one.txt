List the five common HTTP verbs and what the purpose is of each verb.
  - get: to fetch views content
  - post: to upload content and/or add to database
  - delete: to delete content and/or remove from database
  - put: ??
  - update: to rewrite content and/or replace elements in the database

What is Sinatra?
  Sinatra is a hosting service for ruby-based websites

What is MVC?
  The model-view-controller style of creating ruby-based websites, where the controller files navigate
  through webpages, stored in views. It can also add erb content, initiated through models. The models
  stores and interprets data stored in the database.

Why do we follow conventions when creating our actions/path names in our Sinatra routes?
  Sinatra looks for specific directories in the program directory, the directory name
  dictating functionality. However, I don't yet know if websites with different architecture
  can be hosted through ruby. At very least, action names (and potentially path names) following
  a specific convention would make websites in Sinatra easy to edit, improve upon, and understand.

What types of variables are accessible in our view templates without explicitly passing them?
  classes, ids, href values, path values, and parameters are variables that are stored in HTML and CSS.
  Even tags can be potential variables when values are assigned to groups of them in CSS (maybe class or instance).

Given the following block of code, how would I pass an instance variable count with a value of 1 to my index.erb template?

get '/horses' do
  @instance_variable = 1
  erb :index
end

In the same code block, how would I pass a local variable name with a value of Mr. Ed to the view?

get '/horses' do
  local_variable = "Mr. Ed"
  erb :index { local_variables: => local_variable }
end

What's the purpose of ERB?
  To pass computations off to be handled by the controller (and potentially be handled
  elsewhere later) and render site content.

Why do I need a development AND test database?
  Having separate development and test databases reduces run time on tests through the use of fixtures
  (if you're not using factories). As well, data can be muddled up in a test database and be checked against
  the original for errors.

What's responsive design?

What is CRUD and why is it important?
  CRUD stands for create, read, update, destroy. It outlines what functionality all websites, databases,
  and arguably classes and objects, should have in order to be usable.

What does HTTP stand for?
  Hyper-text Transfer Protocol

What are the two ways to interpolate Ruby in an ERB view template? What's the difference between these two ways?
  <=% ... %> => runs ruby code and inserts the output of it's contents into the HTML
  <% ... %> => runs ruby code and produces no output, changes in scope are saved to ERB (environment?)
  #{} => call local variables passed to ERB template

What's an ORM?
  Object Relational Mapping

What's the most commonly used ORM in ruby (Sinatra & Rails)?
  Rails

Let's say we have an application with restaurants. There are seven verb + path combinations necessary to provide full CRUD functionality for our restaurant application. List each of the seven combinations, and explain what each is for.
  - get "/restaurants"
  - get "/restaurants/:id"
  - get "/restaurants/new"
  - post "/restaurants"
  - get "/restaurants/:id/edit"
  - update "/restaurants/:id"
  - delete "/restuarants/:id"

What's a migration?
  A ruby fie that runs database interaction software such as SQL that seeds the database.

When you create a migration, does it automatically modify your database?
  No, the file must be run by running "$ ruby migration_path"

How does a model relate to a database?
  It creates ruby objects from the database, and passes objects created from HTML input to the database.
  It also makes the calls to edit or delete database elements.

What's the difference between agile workflow and waterfall method?
  Agile workflow involves designing small parts of the application, testing them, and implementing them.
  The waterfall method involves designing the entire application, coding it, and then testing it.
  
What is the difference between #new and #create?
